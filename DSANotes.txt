Data structures is the arrangement of data items and the effecient operation on the data.

Data is mandatory

*installed program and apps will be stored in the storage

Data has to be in the main memory in order to process it
How you organize a data so that the program will effeciently utilize and access the data this is data structure

*Databases - arrangement of data in the permanent storage 
Data structure is in main memory*
Database arrangement of data in permanent storage

*Stack and heap memory*
 1 bit is either 0 or 1
1 byte = 8 bits
1024bytes = 1kilobytes

every bytes has its address*

main memory is divided into small addressable unit called bytes*

address will only have 1 value not like coordinate system

65535 = 64kb

larger size ram is not used entirely as one unit but is dividied into segments

usuall size of segment is 64kb*

*How our program uses main memory*

1.the program file or machgine code must be brought into the main memory first into the code section

Example.

void main()
{
	int x = 0;
	double y = 0.0;
}

The 6 bytes is allocated in the stack

Whatever variable you declare inside a function the memory for those variable will be created in the stack.

the memory allocated in the stack will depend on your program ex. how many variable you have. It is calculated during compilation time

*Static memory size is static and it was decided during compile time.

void func2(int i) Parameters also need to allocate memory
{
	int a;
}

the stack unwind after the function finished execution
*how much memory is allocated during a function call depends on the variables and their size that also includes parameters
